I used existing data in Excel to create pivot tables, line graphs, and stacked bar graphs based on crowdfunding failures and successes. 
I started by calculating the amount of money donated and then used a formula to determine whether the percent funded was adequate. I then calculated the percentage of failed, successful and cancelled projects between various ranges.
I used the initial data provided to calculate the mean, median, mode, variance and standard deviation of the failed and successful projects.
